BlockTrading Strategy Builder - Technical Documentation
Overview
The Strategy Builder is a visual drag-and-drop interface built with React Flow that allows users to create trading strategies using a node-based approach with swimlanes for parallel strategy execution. The system uses natural language blocks like "WHEN RSI < 30" and "THEN Buy 10%" to make strategy creation intuitive for traders.
